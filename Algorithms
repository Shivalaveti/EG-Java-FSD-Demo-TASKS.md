Algorithm to check if a number is negative number or positive number
 i) Start
 ii) Input the Number
 iii) If the number is greater than zero, then it it positive number
 iv) If the number is less than zero, then it is negative number
 v) If the number is zero, then it is neither positive nor negative
 vi) Output the result
 vii) Stop

Algorithm to check if a number is prime or not
 i) Start
 ii) Enter the Number
 iii) If the number is less than 2, it's not a prime number
 iv) If the number is 2, it is prime
 v) Iterate from 2 to the square root of the number(inclusive)
 vi) If the number is divisible by any integer in this range, its not prime number
 vii) If the number is not divisible by any integer in this range, its prime
 viii) Output the result
 ix) Stop

Algorithm to check if a number is armstrong
 i) Start
 ii) Input the number
 iii) Find the number of digits in the input number
 iv) Initialize a variable to store the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits
 v) Iterate through each digit of the input number
 vi) Raise each digit to the power of the  number of digits and add it to the sum
 vii) If the sum is equal to the input number, then the number is an Armstrong number,otherwise its not 
 viii) Output the result
 ix) Stop

Algorithm to check if a year is leap year or not
 i) Start
 ii) Input the year
 iii) If the year is divisible by 4, go to next step. If not, the year is not a leap year. END
 iv) If the year is divisible by 100, go to next step. If not, the is a leap year. END
 v) If the year is divisibke by 400, the year is a leap year, if not the year is not a leap year. END

Algorithm to find n factorial of a number
 i) Start
 ii) Input the number n
 iii) Initialize i=1, fact=1
 iv) If (i>n) go to step (viii)
 v) fact=fact * 1
 vi) i = i+1
 vii) go to step (iv)
 viii) Print the value of fact
 ix) Stop
